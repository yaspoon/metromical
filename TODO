Requirements for 1.0:

* Helpfile
* User-configurable keybindings, use KeyBinder
* Check that broken pages are only tried once
* Open next book in series or directory
* Box Zoom/Magnifying Glass - started, postponed for now
* Info file display
* Better code annotation and documentation
* Switch to Subversion
* Store image dimensions permanently
	prefetch image headers to get dimensions

Nice-to-have features:

* Bookmarks, resume last comic book on open
* resizable ComicalBrowser
* Intel/PPC Fat binary on MacOSX, requires latest XCode and Tiger
* run source code through beautifier
* const-correctness
* look for any remaining memory leaks
* the switch to PNG seems to have made startup slower
* Multi-document mode on Mac OS X (i.e., act like a native Mac app)

Long-term whiz-bang features:

* Investigate painting only the damaged rectangle instead of the whole canvas
* OpenGL backend
* New comic book creation wizard
	Could be good vehicle to encourage new file format
* New file format
	JPEG2000 support?
	bzip2 / 7zip / zzip archives?
* proper wxDocManager/wxDocument/wxView implementation
* multi-volume RAR

Bugs:
* When landscape page is shown, make both sets of rotation buttons work
* Automatically generate PNG headers on MacOS X in XCode
